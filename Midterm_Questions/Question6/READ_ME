Write Table, Person, and Simulation classes in Java that keep track of persons
on a U shape table. The table have a capacity of 2N+1 person. One person sits at
the head of the table and there are N seats on each side of the table. There is a
rule that persons preferring cheese sit on one side of the table and persons
preferring dessert sit on the other side of the table. The person, who does not like
either cheese or dessert, sits at the head of the table. The table classâ€™s methods
should include: (a) a constructor; (b) a method that returns the number of
persons sitting on the table or the number of persons with the same taste; (c) a
method that adds a new person to the table; (d) a method that removes a certain
person (known by a PID) or a group of person with the same taste from the
table; (e) a method that prints out the table.
