Write a Java program that simulates tossing a coin repeatedly until the last, say nth, coinâ€™s face value is same as the (n-1)th value and also same as (n-2)th value. The simulation class should write each face value to screen. When the last three face values are the same, it should write the number of elements in the coin tossing series. Make sure that your solution has Coin Class and this class contains toss, isEqualTo, toString methods as well as other necessary methods.
